# What is the command handler database, and why was it created?

Recently I was helping people out with their commands, and I thought, it was much harder to help people without their command handlers, so I compiled all the command handlers into one database, so whether you want to copy the code, or you want to help out a friend, here it is easy for you to read

# How do I use this?

Simply navigate to the file with the command handler you want, and take the code, **IMPORTANT** I am not taking any credit for this code

## How to code

Some people my find coding a discord bot a daunting task at first, you may think you will never learn how to code. Believe me, even whe nfollowing the same tutorials, I made mistakes, I got lot's of error messages while compiling this database. Some tips I have would be to learn basic javascript, and apply logic, **this will improve your workflow 10X**

# Some personal tips and tricks

**1.** I like to use destructuring to format code, and make it easier to write and read. Here is an example:

```
// Instead of doing message.channel.send, like this:
    message.channel.send('hi')
    message.channel.send('bye)

// We can do this
    const { channel } = message
    channel.send('hi')
    channel.send('bye')
```
