# What is the command handler database, and why was it created?

Recently I was helping people out with their commands, and I thought, it was much harder to help people without their command handlers, so I compiled all the command handlers into one database, so whether you want to copy the code, or you want to help out a friend, here it is easy for you to read

# How do I use this?

Simply navigate to the file with the command handler you want, and take the code, **IMPORTANT** I am not taking any credit for this code

# How to code

Some people my find coding a discord bot a daunting task at first, you may think you will never learn how to code. Believe me, even whe nfollowing the same tutorials, I made mistakes, I got lot's of error messages while compiling this database. Some tips I have would be to learn basic javascript, and apply logic, **this will improve your workflow 10X**

## Some personal tips and tricks

**1.** I like to use destructuring to format code, and make it easier to write and read. Here is an example:

```javascript
// Instead of doing message.channel.send, like this:
    message.channel.send('hi')
    message.channel.send('bye)

// We can do this
    const { channel } = message
    channel.send('hi')
    channel.send('bye')
```

**2.** Use visual studio code plugins! These make it much easier to write code and read code, here are some of my favourite (No particular order) 1. [Pretier - makes your code nice and neat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)<br /> 2. [Discord presence - show everyone your coding skills](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode)<br /> 3. [Bracket pair coloriser 2 - It allows you to see different pairs of brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)<br /> 3. [Indent rainbow - It allows you to see your tabs in a prettier way](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)<br />

**3.** DOCUMENTATION - Documentation is very important, it allows you as a developer to see examples of things, and if something is even possible, learn how to read documentation, it really helps with your workflow
